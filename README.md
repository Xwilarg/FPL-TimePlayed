For now your playtime is displayed on a game under the "Notes" section, this section, usually left empty, may contains various information about the game.\
TimePlayed doesn't remove the information written here, but add your playtime on top of it.\
However everything written here is persistent, that means that your playtime will still be written even after deleting TimePlayed
